After copying the files you need to open your project settings inside godot and enable the MSCA. You can find it at the plugins tab of the project settings.

### Quickstart
- After activating the plugin you can find a new tab at the top of godot, next to 2d/3d/AssetLib you should now see the "MSCA" 
- Clicking on the MSCA should show you the main screen of the plugin

- You can either create a full layer system, where all the layers for the clothes and accessoires are created (checkbox "Use Layered Sprites" active) or a smaller layer system, where all layers of the player itself will be one (like you can create with the FarmerSprite Customizer provided in the Farmer Sprite System).
- Pressing the "Create Player Node" Button will create the Player Node inside the currently opened scene.
