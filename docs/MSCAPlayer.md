## The Player Class / MSCAPlayer

This class provides the really basic stuff you need to get the Node system started:
- getting the animationPlayer, the animationTree and the animationState to be useable in script
- settung up a base speed
- storing the facing direction of the character
- function: travel_to_anim(animName, direction)
  This function enables you to use the name of an animation and easily prompt the animationTree to play this animation
